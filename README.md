# Chord-Progressions-to-CSV
Converting the McGill Billboard Data into a readable CSV file.

Hello! I made this portion of my chord progression generation project during the first week-and-a-half of the winter break of my Junior year of high school. 
Although I certainly do intend to improve this sometime in the future, right now I'm pretty busy. If you have any pressing comments, suggestions, or anything 
to say at all, don't hesitate to reach me at my email (cjf8329@nyu.edu). I don't know how licensing or any of that stuff works, so just use your best judgement.
You can do pretty much whatever you want using the data generated, or the generation algorithm itself, but make sure to let me know so I can see what cool stuff you're working on!
